## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * `HTML5`: For structuring the web content.
    * `CSS3`: For styling and visual presentation.
    * `JavaScript`: For interactive elements and dynamic content.
    * `[Add any specific JavaScript frameworks/libraries like jQuery, Bootstrap, React, Vue.js if used]`
* **Backend:**
    * `PHP`: Server-side scripting language for logic and database interaction.
* **Database:**
    * `MySQL`: Relational database management system for storing accessory data, customer info, repair requests, etc.
* **Local Server Environment:**
    * `XAMPP` (or `WampServer`, `Laragon` - mention what you primarily use): For running Apache web server and MySQL database locally during development.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup (Local Development)

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourGitHubUsername]/[your-repo-name].git
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```
2.  **Set up Local Server (XAMPP/WampServer/Laragon):**
    * Ensure `Apache` and `MySQL` services are running.
    * Place the entire project folder (`[your-repo-name]`) into your web server's document root:
        * **XAMPP:** `C:\xampp\htdocs\`
        * **WampServer:** `C:\wamp64\www\`
        * **Laragon:** `C:\laragon\www\`
3.  **Database Setup:**
    * Open `phpMyAdmin` in your browser (usually `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
    * Create a new database named `[your_database_name_here]` (e.g., `mobile_shop_db`).
    * Import the provided SQL dump file:
        * Navigate to the `[your-repo-name]/database/` (or similar) folder in your project.
        * Find the file `[your_database_name_here].sql` (or whatever you named your database export file).
        * In phpMyAdmin, with your newly created database selected, go to the `Import` tab.
        * Click "Choose File" and select `[your_database_name_here].sql`.
        * Click "Go" to import the database schema and data.
4.  **Configure Database Connection:**
    * Open the database connection file in your project (e.g., `[your-repo-name]/config/db_connect.php` or `[your-repo-name]/includes/database.php`).
    * Update the database credentials if necessary. The default for local setups is often:
        ```php
        <?php
        $servername = "localhost";
        $username = "root";
        $password = ""; // Empty password for XAMPP/WampServer/Laragon default MySQL root
        $dbname = "[your_database_name_here]"; // Must match the name you created in phpMyAdmin

        // Create connection
        $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

        // Check connection
        if ($conn->connect_error) {
            die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
        }
        ?>
        ```
5.  **Access the Application:**
    * Open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost/[your-repo-name]/` (or `http://localhost/[your-repo-name]/index.php` if your starting page is `index.php`).
